		<p class = "explaination">The United States of America has been plagued with high crime rates for a while. We aim to help tackle this problem with this site to provide an overview and comparisons of different government datasets about crime, allowing anyone to find correlations between law enforcement and the crime rates. The data has been filtered by state and by topic. We believe this tool will give police departments and elected officials a better understanding of crime in their state, ultimatly making citizens more protected. This tool is organized into three main sections; Police analytics, Crime analytics, and a combination of both. There is also a search bar that provides more detailed knowledge with the expense of no visualization.</p>

			<h1>United States Crime Analytics</h1>
			<p class = "crime_explaination">Here, we can see data for each state for the amount of reports of violent crime, the amount of reported assaulted officers and the amount of reported homicides. The states with the highest amounts of all of these incidents are California and Texas. While that can mostly be explained by differences in population, there are still interesting findings in this data. For example, California has by far the greatest amount of homicides, beating out the next largest state, Texas, by about 700 incidents. </p>

			<h1>United States Law Enforcement Analytics</h1>
			<p class = "police_explaination">This graph has data on the amount of police officrs per 1000 people, total police officer expenditure, and total corrections spending. Interestingly enough, the large population states didn't have the most police expenditure, even though the  crime rate seems to have scaled linearly with the data. This could mean that these states could see a decrease in crime by increasing their amount of police officers. Another interesting point, while California doesn't spend a lot of money of police officers or equipment, they are amongst the highest spenders in the country in terms of correction, such as prisons.</p>
